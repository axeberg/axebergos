NAME
       strace - trace system calls

SYNOPSIS
       strace [-c] [-e EXPR] COMMAND [ARGS...]

DESCRIPTION
       Run  a  command  and  trace system calls made during execution. This is
       useful for debugging and understanding program behavior.

       Each syscall is displayed with its name, arguments, and return value.

OPTIONS
       -c
           Count mode. Instead of printing each syscall, print  a  summary  of
           syscall counts and time spent at the end.

       -e EXPR
           Filter  expression.  Only  trace  syscalls  matching EXPR. Can be a
           syscall name (e.g., "read") or category (e.g., "file").

       -h, --help
           Display usage information and exit.

SYSCALL CATEGORIES
       file
           File I/O: read, write, open, close, seek

       process
           Process control: exit, getpid, waitpid, spawn

       memory
           Memory: alloc, free, mmap

       signal
           Signals: kill, signal, sigblock

EXAMPLES
       Trace all syscalls:

           strace ls

       Count syscalls:

           strace -c cat file.txt

       Trace only file operations:

           strace -e file cat file.txt

OUTPUT FORMAT
       Each line shows:

           syscall_name(args) = return_value

       For example:

           open("/tmp/file.txt", READ) = 3 read(3, buf, 4096) = 42 close(3)  =
           0
